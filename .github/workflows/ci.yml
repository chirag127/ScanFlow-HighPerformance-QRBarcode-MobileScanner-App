# Controls when the workflow will run
# For now, trigger the workflow on push or pull request in the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    name: Build & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository into the working directory

        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup Node.js environment

      # Install project dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Run linters and formatters (Biome is assumed for consistency, but adapt if different)
      # Assuming Biome is configured in biome.json, otherwise use npm scripts
      - name: Lint & Format Check
        run: npm run lint
        # If you use Biome directly, you might use:
        # run: npx @biomejs/biome check --apply-unsafe --apply

      # Run tests using Vitest (assuming Vitest is configured)
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm test
        # Example if using Vitest directly:
        # run: npx vitest run

      # Potentially add E2E tests here if applicable, e.g., with Playwright
      # - name: Run E2E Tests
      #   run: npm run e2e

      # Setup Expo for build (if applicable)

      # Consider separate jobs for Android and iOS builds if needed.

        # Note: Actual build commands for Expo might involve 'eas build' or similar.
